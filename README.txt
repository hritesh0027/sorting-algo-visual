In this Project, Sorting Algorithms are visualized to give a clearer and simpler view on how the sorting algorithms actually works. This can also be used to check Time Complexities of the algorithms. The user can also set the time delay for transitions.

The User Interface was made using Tkinter python GUI using its Combobox, Button and Label classes. 
I created multiple sections in our root frame, one for canvas and one for sub-frame which can be used to draw a bar graph and place the user inputs.
Random data is generated using python's random library. After we have a generated random dataset, we than visualize the given data as a normalized bar graph.

The Sorting Algorithms available here for visualization are : Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
